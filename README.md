# What this is

This is a barebones implementation of Gatsby with ReactiveSearch v3.

## Description

It will search cars by model instead of the brand (as the search by brand is broken, probably by how the dataset was created or some other implementation issue) by contrary to the official docs that are misleading in saying it will search for brand. 

This was tested extensively

Also it allows to search by the rating of maker/model
